I'm so excited to finally have my website and blog back up and running! It's been way too long.

Getting my personal website back up and running has been a goal that I've been working towards for several months, but with lots going on at work, a baby at home, and lots of other commitments, it's been a slow process. Plus, I am a little bit of a perfectionist who was reluctant to press the publish button. However, I've worked steadily as I've had time, and I'm glad to finally be relaunching alex-p.com today!

[If you were at all familiar with my old website, it was very much in need of a facelift. Launched about a decade ago, the web has come a long way since, and I did not keep my own site up with the last trends and best practices. At some point in the last year or so, a PHP upgrade had also broken my old blog. I took a look over things earlier this year and determined that it was best to start over with a totally clean slate. So, I deleted my entire old website, started over from scratch, and am now ready to launch with what you see today! There are a few things that are still a work in progress, but I'll be continuing to add and tweak things moving forward.

I'm most excited to be bringing you this blog. For a long time, technology has been one of my biggest passions, and probably my strongest skill. However, writing is another interest of mine that I haven't fully had the chance to explore in recent years. On my old website, I had a blog, but it was fairly unfocused from a topical perspective, and I eventually lost interest due to that lack of focus and limited time.

However, over the past year, smart home technology and home automation have become hobbies of mine, and as I've developed, learned, and explored the world of the smart home, I've realized that there is room on the Internet for another voice in this space. That's where I hope to come in. I believe smart home technology can be intimidating for some, and cumbersome for others. It can feel like a disconnected mish-mash of products and services. However, it doesn't have to be this way. With a little bit of guidance, an automated home can be accessible to anyone.

I'll therefore mainly be using this blog as a tool to provide that guidance. I want to use what I've learned about the smart home to provide help to others. You'll see tips and tricks, tutorials, demonstrations, product reviews, and more, to help you in your journey to a smarter home. If you have any particular topics you'd like me to explore further, I welcome your feedback in both the comments for any blog post, or by reaching out to me on the [contact page.](https://alex-p.com/contact)

Though I won't hold myself to a specific update schedule as things get started, I hope to be able to post about once a week. Thanks for reading!
